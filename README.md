# SS.lv scraper 

A spare time project I've done for my exploratory data analysis experiments:
 * An SS.LV scraper bot (using scrapy): only cars and flats parsers.
 * A web-interface (Flask, Bokeh): explore charts like "car year vs price" or "price vs flat square" and distributions. 
 
To run scraper you will additioaly need up and running:
 * Anaconda
 * MongoDB
 * Prerender

Sample output data and example research can be found in this repository: https://github.com/danaki/ss-scraper-sample
